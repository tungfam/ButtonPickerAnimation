Check out the easy button animations

## 1. Initial View controller ##
Here you can see 3 buttons that disappears when clicked, then it shows the activity indicator (at this point you may do a server request), then selected state is shown in the middle (or not).

## 2. Star VC View controller ##
This one is much more simple if you just want a nice animation of the button selection.
